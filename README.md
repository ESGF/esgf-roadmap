# ESGF Roadmap
Plan out roadmap for development and testing activities for ESGF in preparation for CMIP7

* The [core-architecture](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/tree/main/core_architecture) folder contains overviews and designs for a new ESGF-NG core architecture.
* The [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/ESGF/projects/3/views/1) has all activities related to the ESGF-NG core architecture. You must be onboarded to the ESGF GitHub organization to view the project. Be sure to use the tabs at the top of the project view to explore other project views.
