# 2025-03-03 ESGF-NG Status

ESGF-NG status as of March 3, 2025.

**NOTE:** ESGF-NG will be used for CMIP7 and subsequent activities. *None of the below applies to CMIP6 or earlier activities.*

## What has changed?
* **Index Consolidation** - ESGF-NG consolidates federation search indices from roughly a half dozen peer-to-peer indices to two synchronized catalogs: an "East" catalog operated by UK-CEDA and a "West" catalog operated by US-Globus. The two catalogs are synchronized such that any change in one will shortly (not necessarily instantaneously) be reflected in the other. See the Status Updates section below for details about the East and West catalogs.
* **Move to STAC** - ESGF-NG replaces the simple search index (implemented in Apache Solr) with a STAC catalog. See [stacspec.org](https://stacspec.org/) for API and data model specifications. ESGF discovery and data access interfaces must use the STAC APIs provided by the East and/or West ESGF catalogs. (The APIs are identical and their contents are synchronized, but they're physically hosted on different continents and operated independently.)
* **Choice of Authentication Services (for Publication)** - We continue to use the ESGF-Publisher application for data publication. Each modeling center will configure the publisher application to work against either the East or the West ESGF STAC catalog. Publishing requires an initial registration with one of the ESGF STAC catalogs and subsequent authentication for each application run. Centers that prefer Globus authentication will use the West STAC catalog. Centers that prefer EGI Check-In authentication will use the East STAC catalog. See the Status Updates section below for details about publisher registration.
* **Enhanced Metadata Validation** - The East and West STAC catalogs perform metadata validation for all catalog changes (publication, updates, and retractions). The catalogs will reject new items (or updates to existing items) if the supplied metadata does not observe the CMIP7 metadata schema or the controlled vocabularies for field values.
* **ESGF Event Stream** - The ESGF core architecture now includes an event stream. While the primary purpose of this event stream is to synchronize the East and West STAC catalogs, the event stream offers a new way for ESGF services to take action in response to catalog changes. For instance, an ESGF data node can monitor the event stream and create local replicas of high-interest datasets as they appear in the catalog. Or, the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF) may execute assessments when high-interest datasets become available at specific data nodes. See the Status Updates section below for details about the ESGF event stream.

## Conceptual Overview and Design
* [ESGF-NG proposal](https://github.com/lliming/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/core_architecture/proposal.md), agreed to at the 10th ESGF Conference, Rockville, MD, April 23–26, 2024.
* Design documents are available in the [ESGF/esgf-roadmap](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap) GitHub repository. See core-architecture folder.
* Our current work is consistent with the design as written.

## Status Updates

The ESGF-NG team is currently conducting a series of [data challenges](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/tree/main/data-challenges) (trial runs of the ESGF-NG system) to validate the expected behavior of the end-to-end ESGF-NG system. The first section below contains updates on these data challenges. Subsequent sections provide technical details about the state of the STAC catalogs, the ESGF discovery and data access applications, the ESGF event stream, and the ESGF replicator application.

### Data Challenges
* [Data Challenge 1](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/01-Publication.md) is an end-to-end publication test. CEDA and Globus each publish 500 unique datasets (drawn from CMIP6) to their own STAC catalog. When finished, the two STAC catalogs are compared to verify that they are synchronized and have all 1000 catalog entries.
  * Globus and CEDA have both published their 500 datasets. When completed, the catalogs had 999 entries, because one dataset was published twice. The asset lists for all datasets were different because of an encoding/decoding issue in the West catalog.
  * CEDA has not yet enabled EGI Check-In authentication/authorization in the East STAC catalog. Globus authentication/authorization is working in the West STAC catalog.
  * Neither East nor West has enabled metadata schema or CV validation.
* [Data Challenge 2](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/02-Retraction.md) is an end-to-end publication and retraction test. It has not begun.
* [Data Challenge 3](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/03-Update.md) is an end-to-end publication and update test. It has not begun.
* Design of Data Challenges 4 and beyond is underway and will likely take the form of repeating challenges 1-3 with datasets from other ESGF projects (e.g., Obs4MIPS).

### STAC Catalogs

* **West catalog:**
  * Globus has deployed multiple instances of the West STAC catalog for use in data challenges. Each instance has a distinct STAC Transaction API, event consumer, back-end Globus Search index, and STAC Discovery API. The STAC Transaction API and event consumer in each instance are configured to use a distinct topic on the event stream. This allows multiple data challenge runs to take place with distinct instances.
  * The West catalog supports Globus authentication and authorization.
  * The Globus ESGF team is also preparing the processes and documentation necessary to transition deployment and operation of these components to the Globus operations team.
* **East catalog:**
  * CEDA has deployed an instance of the East STAC catalog for use in the first data challenge and is preparing to deploy multiple instances for subsequent data challenges.
  * Code to support EGI Check-In authentication and authorization is in development.
* **Both catalogs:**
  * Code to support item updates and retractions is in the process of being merged for testing.
  * Code to support error reporting on the event stream is in development.

#### Publisher Registration

Publisher registration for both East and West STAC catalogs is currently a manual process. Catalog operators must manually set up authorization policy.  
* The West catalog requires authentication and enforces authorization policy configured by the catalog operators. Authorization policy is implemented using group membership.
* The East catalog does not require authentication, but the API endpoint is not publicly visible.

#### Metadata Schema and Controlled Vocabularies
The ESGF STAC catalogs will enforce metadata schema and controlled vocabulary validation for all catalog additions and updates.
* Code to support metadata schema validation is in the process of being merged for testing.
* Code to support controlled vocabulary validation is in development.

### Discovery and Data Access Applications
All pre-CMIP7 ESGF discovery and data access applications must be updated to use the new STAC catalog(s). Because we are now using STAC, we can now use STAC applications that have been in widespread use by the geospatial data community.

* CHECK IT OUT: DKRZ’s customisation of the STAC Browser. It includes support for JupyterLite and visualisations:

* Other tools outside our control (who need to be reached out to)
  * Esgpull
  * CMCC
  * Climate4Impact
  * ESMValTool
  * ESGF-py-client - we intend to deprecate this application

### Event Stream

The ESGF event stream service is operated by Globus as part of the ESGF2-US project.  We are currently using [Confluent Data Streaming](https:/www.confluent.io), a managed Apache Kafka deployment hosted in AWS.

The event stream is currently being used for our ESGF-NG data challenges.
* Write access (ability to post events) is restricted to the East and West STAC catalogs.
* Read access (ability to subscribe to topics and read events) is limited to the CEDA and Globus teams who are conducting the data challenges.

Before beginning production operation, we expect we will redeploy the service on a new Kafka cluster within the Confluent service. This should have no effect on clients other than an endpoint address change.

We are aiming for May/June to onboard engineers for the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF) team to enable them to explore the event stream with events from one or more ESGF-NG data challenges.

### ESGF Replicator Application

The ESGF Replicator application is a planned ESGF application to be used by ESGF data node operators. When deployed and configured by an ESGF data node operator, the application will monitor the ESGF event stream for new and updated datasets. When datasets are seen that match a local replication profile, the application will create replicas of those datasets on the data node. If the data node is authorized to do so, the application will also update the datasets' entries in the ESGF STAC catalog to register the new replicas.

There is currently no technical design for the ESGF Replicator application.  See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ESGF2-us/esgf-replicator) for user stories, requirements, and key design points. There has been speculation that the ESGpull application may be a good starting point for the ESGF Replicator application.

We are planning a design meeting (as a virtual workshop) and an announcement will be made when it has been scheduled.
