# 2025-07-01 ESGF-NG Status

ESGF-NG status as of July 1, 2025.

**NOTE:** ESGF-NG will be used for CMIP7 and subsequent activities. *None of the below applies to CMIP6 or earlier activities.*

## ESGF-NG Project Description
ESGF-NG is the next generation of the core architecture for the Earth System Grid Federation. Designed in 2024 and deployed in 2025, it replaces the ESGF-1.0 core architecture. See [ESGF-NG Docs](../docs/README.md) for further information.

## Design Status
Our current work is still consistent with the [design as written](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/core_architecture/design.md).

## Status Updates
Updates are divided into two sections: data challenges and component status. Data challenges are end-to-end tests of the ESGF-NG core architecture and related components, by which we assure ourselves that the system is ready for CMIP7 publishing and discovery. The component status sections provide details about individual sub-components of the ESGF-NG core architecture. (Component details become less important as time passes.)

### Data Challenges
The ESGF-NG team is currently conducting a series of [data challenges](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/tree/main/data-challenges) (trial runs of the ESGF-NG system) to validate the expected behavior of the end-to-end ESGF-NG system.

* **Completed:** [Data Challenge 1 (rounds 1 & 2)](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/01-Publication.md), end-to-end publication. CEDA and Globus each published 500+ unique datasets (drawn from CMIP6) to their own STAC catalogs. When finished, the two STAC catalogs were compared to confirm they were synchronized and both catalogs had all entries.
* **In Progress:** [Data Challenges 2](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/02-Retraction.md) and [3](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/03-Update.md) and 5, end-to-end publication, update, and retraction, including ESGF client application testing. Code changes have been merged in STAF FastAPI, STAC Transaction Extension, ESGF-NG STAC Transaction API, and ESGF-NG Event Consumer, including posting errors on the ESGF event stream. Both ESGF2-US and CEDA expect to run this challenge by mid-July, and *we need ESGF client applications to test against the resulting STAC catalog.* (We are counting on the ESGF XC to coordinate the latter testing activity with us and with individual client application teams.)
* **Next Up:** Data Challenge 1 (Round 3) and Data Challenge 4, schema and CV validation for multiple ESGF projects. Code changes to STAC catalog components and input datasets for CMIP6 are ready to use. We need the ESGVOC team to generate a STAC extension for Input4MIPS, and we need to prepare an input dataset using previously-published Input4MIPS datasets. Then, we will perform the publications and updates by the end of July and make the resulting STAC catalogs available for client application testing.

We expect ESGF client application testing against the STAC catalogs produced by the data challenges above to identify issues with the STAC catalogs that we will need to prioritize and address.

Reminder: We still have no technical design for handling catalog consistency errors published on the ESGF event stream by the event consumer. Our plan is to monitor the errors that occur and use that to develop an error-handing strategy, which will likely be a combination of manual and automated processing.

### ESGF-NG Components

#### STAC Transaction API
The Transaction API enables STAC clients to make changes to the catalog. It accepts POST (new item) and PATCH (item modification) requests, and for each request, it:
1. confirms the authorization of the request,
2. validates the item metadata, and
3. posts an event on the ESGF Event Stream.

It does not implement changes in the catalog: that is performed by the Event Consumer.

In the past two months, CEDA contributed code to the STAC Transaction Extension, STAC FastAPI reference implementation, and ESGF STAC Transaction API to support PATCH (item modification) requests.

CEDA also contributed code to the ESGF STAC Transaction API to validate metadata (both for new items and for item modifications). For new items, validation is performed against the STAC extensions declared in the item. For item modifications, the STAC Collection ID is used to determine which STAC extensions should be used.

Globus contributed a new STAC client tool for making PATCH (item modification) requests, and code for generating input data for data challenges based on an input list of dataset IDs. The input data generated includes both complete items and item modifications, and also includes intentional errors to test our metadata validation features.

All of the above contributions have been merged and are ready for testing.

#### Event Consumer
The Event Consumer subscribes to the ESGF Event Stream, reads events from the stream, and performs the corresponding changes in a STAC Catalog.

In the past two months, the Globus team contributed code to support item modifications in a Globus Search backend. (See STAC Transaction API above for the corresponding changes.) The code performs the required catalog update in the backend. If it detects a consistency error, it publishes an error to the ESGF Event Stream's error topic.

The error event schema is preliminary and may change to address issues identified during testing or early data publication.

This contribution been merged and is ready for testing.

#### Authentication and Authorization
The STAC Transaction API (see above) authenticates all client requests and authorizes requests against active project and data node registrations. The system used for authentication and authorization is configurable.
* For the ESGF-West STAC catalog, authentication is performed via Globus, and registration is performed via Globus Group memberships.
* For the ESGF-East STAC catalog, authentication is performed via EGI-Check In and registration is performed via EGI-Check In attributes.

The Globus implementation has been tested in previous data challenges.

In June, CEDA completed creation of its ESGF-East virtual organization with EGI-Check In. CEDA also contributed the necessary code to the ESGF Publisher and STAC Transacation API to perform EGI-Check In authentication. The current implementation using the OIDC "authorization code" flow. At some point in the future (as a low-priority development), CEDA plans to change this to the device flow.

#### Metadata Schema and Controlled Vocabularies
The ESGF STAC catalogs will enforce metadata schema and controlled vocabulary validation for all catalog additions and updates. As described above in STAC Transaction API, the STAC extensions published by the ESGVOC team (one per ESGF project) will be used for this validation.

In July, the ESGVOC team will prepare a STAC extension for the Input4MIPS project. We will isolate some of the previously published Input4MIPS datasets and use it as part of our input data for the data challenges described above. (The remainder of the input data will come from CMIP6.) This will serve as a test of our ability to validate new items and item updates for multiple ESGF projects.

We have informed the ESGF WIP and the ESGVOC team that it is essential that each ESGF project supply JSON schema and STAC extensions before the project will be able to publish data using ESGF-NG.

#### Catalog Consistency Errors
[No sugnificant changes since last month.]
When catalog changes are requested via the STAC API (e.g., new items, item updates including retractions), the API is not designed to return an error code to the calling client application if the change cannot be made in the catalog because of a consistency error. (E.g., if a new item is published and it conflicts with an existing item, or if a retraction is requested and the item does not exist.) Instead, the API will return a code indicating a deferred operation and the STAC catalog will generate an error on the ESGF event stream's "errors" topic.

We currently do not have a plan for what to do with errors reported on the event stream.

### Production Deployments

[No significant changes since last month.]

* **Both catalogs:**
  * Both East and West have performed multiple deployments of the STAC Transaction API, Event Consumer, and STAC Discovery API for the data challenges. We are preparing documentation and plans for these deployments to be handled by local operations personnel by the time we launch the public ESGF-NG service.
  * East and West are using common STAC Transaction API code (with separate configs for auth, Globus v. EGI Check-In) and common event consumer code (with separate backends: Globus Search and ElasticSearch).
  * The catalogs still use separate STAC Discovery API code. (No plans to change that, presently.)
  * Support for item updates and retractions is being tested presently.
  * Code to support error reporting on the event stream is in development.
  * Code to support controlled vocabulary validation is pending a feature release from the ESGVOC project.
* **West catalog:**
  * The West catalog supports Globus authentication and authorization and uses a Globus Search backend.
  * The Globus ESGF team is also preparing the processes and documentation necessary to transition deployment and operation of these components to the Globus operations team.
* **East catalog:**
  * The East catalog supports EGI Check-In authentication and authorization and uses an ElasticSearch backend (hosted on JASMIN).

The CEDA team is in communication with EGI with plans to move to the production environment and is also looking into moving its transaction api to the production url.

The Globus team has begun working with our Operations team to plan production deployments of the ESGF-West core architecture including the ESGF Event Stream.
* We anticipate two production environments for ESGF-West: Production (what the ESGF community sees and uses) and Staging (the next version of the Production environment deployed for testing).
* Releases to Production and Staging will be coordinated via a GitHub tagging convention. For components shared with the ESGF-East team (STAC Transaction API and Event Consumer), we will coordinate a release tagging convention that allows each team to release independently of the other.
* Production and Staging will each have a distinct Event Stream service, allowing testing in the Staging environment without changing the contents of the Production system.
* We are targeting July 15 for availability of both Production and Staging environments.
* Our development team will continue operating development deployments separately from Production and Staging.

The Globus team is also developing a [contingency plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EeyK2mFzMsi_EM1EMj8K5GHGw6QjRpdEV1QXEiKi7JM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6rze9rgan90j) for handing off the ESGF Event Stream to another operator in the event that we are no longer able to operate it.

### Publisher Registration
[No significant changes since last month.]

Publisher registration for both East and West STAC catalogs is currently a manual process. Catalog operators must manually set up authorization policy.

### ESGF Replicator Application
[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF Replicator application is a planned ESGF application to be used by ESGF data node operators. When deployed and configured by an ESGF data node operator, the application will monitor the ESGF event stream for new and updated datasets. When datasets are seen that match a local replication profile, the application will create replicas of those datasets on the data node. If the data node is authorized to do so, the application will also update the datasets' entries in the ESGF STAC catalog to register the new replicas.

There is currently no written technical design for the ESGF Replicator application.  See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ESGF2-us/esgf-replicator) for user stories, requirements, and key design points.

A new design team met for the first time on 2025-04-30 to review the materials above and begin planning an implementation strategy.
* We confirmed the approach of using esgpull as the basis for the replicator. This will represent a new usage mode for esgpull. Specifically, instead of the current mode which performs a **catalog search** for relevant datasets, this new mode will review **new publication events** on the ESGF event stream to identify relevant datasets.
* Several of the features on the replicator list are already on esgpull's agenda, and we'll rely on the existing team to implement these, with possible help from the replicator team.
* The ESGF2-US/Globus team will contribute Globus Transfer support to esgpull.
* The ESGF-NG team (mainly ESGF2-US and CEDA) will contribute event stream support (as an alternative to catalog search).

### Event Stream
[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF event stream service is operated by Globus as part of the ESGF2-US project.  We are currently using [Confluent Data Streaming](https:/www.confluent.io), a managed Apache Kafka deployment hosted in AWS.

The event stream is currently being used for our ESGF-NG data challenges.
* Write access (ability to post events) is restricted to the East and West STAC catalogs.
* Read access (ability to subscribe to topics and read events) is limited to the CEDA and Globus teams who are conducting the data challenges.

Before beginning production operation, we expect we will redeploy the service on a new Kafka cluster within the Confluent service. This should have no effect on clients other than an endpoint address change.

We are aiming for May/June to onboard engineers for the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF) team to enable them to explore the event stream with events from one or more ESGF-NG data challenges.

### Discovery and Data Access Applications
[No significant changes since last month.]

All pre-CMIP7 ESGF discovery and data access applications must be updated to use the new STAC catalog(s). Because we are now using STAC, we can now use STAC applications that have been in widespread use by the geospatial data community.
