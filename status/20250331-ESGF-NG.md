# 2025-03-31 ESGF-NG Status

ESGF-NG status as of March 31, 2025.

**NOTE:** ESGF-NG will be used for CMIP7 and subsequent activities. *None of the below applies to CMIP6 or earlier activities.*

## ESGF-NG Project Description
ESGF-NG is the next generation of the core architecture for the Earth System Grid Federation. Designed in 2024 and deployed in 2025, it replaces the ESGF-1.0 core architecture. See [ESGF-NG Docs](../docs/README.md) for further information.

## Design Status
Our current work is still consistent with the [design as written](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/core_architecture/design.md).

## Status Updates

The ESGF-NG team is currently conducting a series of [data challenges](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/tree/main/data-challenges) (trial runs of the ESGF-NG system) to validate the expected behavior of the end-to-end ESGF-NG system. The first section below contains updates on these data challenges. Subsequent sections provide technical details about the state of the STAC catalogs, the ESGF discovery and data access applications, the ESGF event stream, and the ESGF replicator application.

### Data Challenges
* [Data Challenge 1](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/01-Publication.md) is an end-to-end publication test. CEDA and Globus each publish 500 unique datasets (drawn from CMIP6) to their own STAC catalog. When finished, the two STAC catalogs are compared to verify that they are synchronized and have all 1000 catalog entries.
  * Round 1 - Globus and CEDA have both completed rounds 1 and 2 with 500 datasets each (one duplicate). The duplicate dataset was detected and rejected by both catalogs. The asset lists for all datasets were different because of an encoding/decoding issue in the West catalog.
  * Round 2 - Globus and EGI-Check In authorization worked. Schema validation worked for positive cases, but the input data contained no negative cases. We will include negative cases in Round 3. (See timeline above.)
  * Round 3 - [ESGVOC code](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-vocab) is available from IPSL/CEDA. It does not currently seem to support projects other than CMIP6? (We'll need support for any projects that plan to publish to ESGF-NG.) Integration with STAC Transaction API (inc. mechanism for updating data without interrupting service) is underway.
* [Data Challenge 2](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/02-Retraction.md) is an end-to-end publication and retraction test. We are currently wrapping up the code changes to support updates (inc. retraction) in the STAC Transaction API and Event Consumer components. Both ESGF2-US and CEDA expect to run this challenge by the end of April.
* [Data Challenge 3](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap/blob/main/data-challenges/03-Update.md) is an end-to-end publication and update test. We are currently wrapping up the code changes to support updates (inc. retraction) in the STAC Transaction API and Event Consumer components. Both ESGF2-US and CEDA expect to run this challenge by the end of April.
* Design of Data Challenges 4 and beyond is underway and will likely take the form of repeating challenges 1-3 with datasets from other ESGF projects (e.g., OBS4MIPS). We hope to onboard the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework team to the Event Stream used in this data challenge so they can begin planning an integration with the event stream.

### STAC Catalogs

* **Both catalogs:**
  * Both East and West have performed multiple deployments of the STAC Transaction API, Event Consumer, and STAC Discovery API for the data challenges. We are preparing documentation and plans for these deployments to be handled by local operations personnel by the time we launch the public ESGF-NG service.
  * East and West are using common STAC Transaction API code (with separate configs for auth, Globus v. EGI Check-In).
  * East and West are using common event consumer code (with separate backends: Globus Search and ElasticSearch).
  * The catalogs still use separate STAC Discovery API code. (No plans to change that, presently.)
  * Code to support item updates and retractions is in the process of being merged for testing.
  * Code to support error reporting on the event stream is in development.
* **West catalog:**
  * The West catalog supports Globus authentication and authorization and uses a Globus Search backend.
  * The Globus ESGF team is also preparing the processes and documentation necessary to transition deployment and operation of these components to the Globus operations team.
* **East catalog:**
  * The East catalog supports EGI Check-In authentication and authorization and uses an ElasticSearch backend (hosted on JASMIN).

#### Publisher Registration

Publisher registration for both East and West STAC catalogs is currently a manual process. Catalog operators must manually set up authorization policy.

#### Metadata Schema and Controlled Vocabularies
The ESGF STAC catalogs will enforce metadata schema and controlled vocabulary validation for all catalog additions and updates.
* Metadata schema validation (for CMIP6) is currently being tested in data challenge 01 rounds 2 and 3.
* Code to support controlled vocabulary validation (for CMIP6) is in development.
* Schema and CV validation for projects beyond CMIP6 is pending implementation by the ESGVOC team (IPSL, CEDA) and will be incorporated into our STAC Transaction API when available.

#### Error Reporting (catalog consistency errors)
When catalog changes are requested via the STAC API (e.g., new items, item updates including retractions), the API is not designed to return an error code to the calling client application if the change cannot be made in the catalog because of a consistency error. (E.g., if a new item is published and it conflicts with an existing item, or if a retraction is requested and the item does not exist.) Instead, the API will return a code indicating a deferred operation and the STAC catalog will generate an error on the ESGF event stream's "errors" topic.

We currently do not have a plan for what to do with errors reported on the event stream.

### Event Stream

[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF event stream service is operated by Globus as part of the ESGF2-US project.  We are currently using [Confluent Data Streaming](https:/www.confluent.io), a managed Apache Kafka deployment hosted in AWS.

The event stream is currently being used for our ESGF-NG data challenges.
* Write access (ability to post events) is restricted to the East and West STAC catalogs.
* Read access (ability to subscribe to topics and read events) is limited to the CEDA and Globus teams who are conducting the data challenges.

Before beginning production operation, we expect we will redeploy the service on a new Kafka cluster within the Confluent service. This should have no effect on clients other than an endpoint address change.

We are aiming for May/June to onboard engineers for the ESGF Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF) team to enable them to explore the event stream with events from one or more ESGF-NG data challenges.

### Discovery and Data Access Applications
All pre-CMIP7 ESGF discovery and data access applications must be updated to use the new STAC catalog(s). Because we are now using STAC, we can now use STAC applications that have been in widespread use by the geospatial data community.

| Application | Status |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Radiant Earth STAC Browser | 2/11: Done |
| DKRZâ€™s customisation of the STAC Browser. (Includes support for JupyterLite and visualisations) | https://eerie.cloud.dkrz.de/ & https://gitlab.dkrz.de/data-infrastructure-services/cloudify/-/tree/main/workshop?ref_type=head |
| Metagrid | 3/31: Started in early March and still in progress |
| Intake-esgf | 3/31: Started by 2/11; still underway |
| Esg-pull | 3/31: Not started, might be used for data replication so would be covered as part of that effort |
| Wget-API | 3/31 - Not started |

Other tools outside our control (who need to be reached out to)
  * CMCC
  * Climate4Impact
  * ESMValTool
  * ESGF-py-client - we intend to deprecate this application

### ESGF Replicator Application

[No significant changes since last month.]

The ESGF Replicator application is a planned ESGF application to be used by ESGF data node operators. When deployed and configured by an ESGF data node operator, the application will monitor the ESGF event stream for new and updated datasets. When datasets are seen that match a local replication profile, the application will create replicas of those datasets on the data node. If the data node is authorized to do so, the application will also update the datasets' entries in the ESGF STAC catalog to register the new replicas.

There is currently no technical design for the ESGF Replicator application.  See the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ESGF2-us/esgf-replicator) for user stories, requirements, and key design points. There has been speculation that the ESGpull application may be a good starting point for the ESGF Replicator application.

We are planning a design meeting (as a virtual workshop) and an announcement will be made when it has been scheduled.
